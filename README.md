# FREERTOS_STM
Implementation of FREERTOS with stm32
brainstorming questions while implementing code 

Semaphores
- are binary semaphores sufficient for task executions?  no danger of priority inversions 
- priority inversion - higher priority has to wait as some low priority task has the semaphore
- counting semaphores ... are they a good way??
- what are the benefits??
